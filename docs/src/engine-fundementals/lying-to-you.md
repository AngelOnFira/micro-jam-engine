# Lying to you

In this engine, as well as in this documentation book, there are several places
where you've been "lied to". Well, not really a lie, but maybe not the full truth. This is primarily to make it easier to discuss
concepts at a higher level, not fall down too many rabbit holes, and keep things
less complex.
