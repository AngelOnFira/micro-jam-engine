# Getting started

For ease of setup, this engine is designed to work in Codespaces first. This is
primarily to remove any barriers to getting up and running.

That being said, working locally on your system with Rust installed is equally
viable. There shouldn't be any barriers to just running `cargo run`, though
you'll need to [install trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install) to get your game
running in the browser.
